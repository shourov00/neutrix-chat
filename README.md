# ðŸš€ Welcome to Your New Nuetrix Script

This project is a React application bundled using Webpack into a single JavaScript file. The bundled file can be integrated into any website via a script tag.

## Objective

### Integration

After building the project, the output JavaScript file can be integrated into any website by including it as a script tag:

```bash
<script async defer src="http://localhost:8080/neutrix.js?siteId=123123123"></script>
```

### Integration

1. Script Injection:
   The application expects to be included on a website via a script tag. It retrieves the siteId from the script's URL query parameters to configure the app.

2. Application Initialization:
   The App component is rendered into a dynamically created div with an id of root. The siteId parameter is passed to the App component, allowing it to function based on the specific site.
